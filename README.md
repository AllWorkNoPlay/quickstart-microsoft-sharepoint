This Quick Start reference deployment includes architectural considerations and configurations used to build a Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016 environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. We discuss how to build and configure the necessary AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to deploy a highly available SharePoint farm across separate AWS Availability Zones.
